## Jozour-IT - Asset Management System

This is a FOSS project for asset management in IT Operations. Knowing who has which laptop, when it was purchased in order to depreciate it correctly, handling software licenses, etc.

It is built on [Laravel 8](http://laravel.com).

Jozour-IT is actively developed and we [release quite frequently](https://github.com/jozour/jozour-it/releases). ([Check out the live demo here](https://jozouritapp.com/demo/).)

__This is web-based software__. This means there is no executable file (aka no .exe files), and it must be run on a web server and accessed through a web browser. It runs on any Mac OSX, flavor of Linux, as well as Windows, and we have a [Docker image](https://jozour-it.readme.io/docs/docker) available if that's what you're into.
